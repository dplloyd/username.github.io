Cycling Scotland maintains a live dataset of the total numnber of bikes counted by their network of automatic counters. This dashboard is an attempt to use the uSmart API to summarise the frequency of bike trips detected by these sensors in the past 7 days, and compare that further to the next previous week. Current version is just a proof of concept; I'd like this to update automatically, which I think will need Docker and GitHub actions... Dates aren't quite right, either!
